# revisiting-dubois

This is _Revisiting Du Bois_, a website bringing Du Bois' visualizations to
modern day.

### Technical guide / notes

This is a React app scaffolded by `create-react-app`. Viewers are welcome to
download the repo and view the project status through `npm install` followed by
`npm start` (you must have Node and npm installed for this to work).

Most of the visualizations from this project are planned to be completed with
d3.js and the ggdubois R package (under construction). Some of the UI components
of the website are planned to be completed with three.js and React Spring, and
the design of the library will be completed mostly with the Material-UI library
in JavaScript.
